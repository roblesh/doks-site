## Why does Advance exist?

Because you do - and Jesus died to get your attention and to have a meaningful relationship with you. We desire that the whole world would know Him and make Him known, in all things.

## How does Advance do that?

Advance creates content to establish, educate, equip, and empower people to know what the Bible REALLY says about being a disciple of Jesus.
