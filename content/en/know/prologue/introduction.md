## Knowing For Yourself

Too many people settle for knowing about Jesus, instead of personally knowing Him. Knowing Him comes from studying the Bible and allowing the Holy Spirit to govern our understanding and prayers in such a manner where listening to the voice of God is not foreign to us, but common.

You can go from knowing about Him to personally knowing Him by diving into different subjects, including how the Bible is structured to learning about what happens after we die.
